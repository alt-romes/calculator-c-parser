# Calculator C Parser
A simple implementation of a parser and its use to calculate simple mathematical expressions

I haven't written a detailed description here, for now you can read the code that is hopefully well commented.

Any questions can be posed in Discussions or Issues

This was written while developing a more complete parser for [programmer-calculator](https://github.com/alt-romes/programmer-calculator)
