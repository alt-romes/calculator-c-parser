# Calculator C Parser
A simple implementation of a parser and its use to calculate simple mathematical expressions

I haven't written a detailed description here yet, but the code is fully commented to help readers understand how the parser works - and hopefully it'll inspire you to create your own after reading it

Any questions can be posed in Discussions or Issues

This was written while developing a more complete parser for [programmer-calculator](https://github.com/alt-romes/programmer-calculator)
