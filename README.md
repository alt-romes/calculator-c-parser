# Calculator C Parser
A simple implementation of a parser and its use to calculate simple mathematical expressions

I haven't written a detailed description here, but the code is fully commented to help readers understand how the parser works - and hopefully you can understand it completely and be inspired to create your own just by reading it.

Any questions can be posed in Discussions or Issues

This was written while developing a more complete parser for [programmer-calculator](https://github.com/alt-romes/programmer-calculator)
